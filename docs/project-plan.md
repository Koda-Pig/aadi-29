# Space-Themed Scrolling Birthday Website Concept (React Implementation)

## Project Overview

This React-based website will serve as a digital birthday card for my fiancée, featuring an immersive space-themed experience where scrolling reveals personalized messages and photos. The design will use a neutral color palette (black, white, brown, green) and leverage Three.js for mesmerizing animations, with full mobile and desktop compatibility.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies

- React for component-based UI development
- Three.js for 3D rendering and animations
- React Three Fiber as a React renderer for Three.js
- Responsive design using media queries and flexible layouts
- Touch events handling for mobile interactions

### Performance Considerations

- Code splitting to reduce initial load time
- Lazy loading for images and heavy components
- Dynamic adjustment of particle count and effects based on device capability
- useCallback and useMemo for optimization of expensive calculations

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Landing Screen

- Initial view shows a minimal space scene with subtle star particles
- Fiancée's name appears, formed by stars coming together
- Simple instruction text fades in: "Scroll to explore our universe"
- Subtle downward arrow animation indicates scrolling direction

### 2. Navigation Mechanics

- Vertical scrolling drives the entire experience
- Each scroll action moves the camera deeper into space
- Smooth scroll animation using React spring or framer-motion
- Touch swipe and drag support for mobile devices

### 3. Content Progression

- Messages and photos appear at predetermined scroll points
- Content fades in as you approach and slowly fades out as you move past
- Each section has unique particle density and subtle color variation
- Content organized chronologically or thematically

## Visual Design Elements

### Space Environment

- Star field created with particle system (varying sizes and brightness)
- Distant nebula-like formations using gradient colors from the palette
- Subtle parallax effect where distant stars move slower than close ones
- Occasional floating particles that react to mouse/touch movement

### Message Display

- Text appears as glowing elements with soft outer glow
- Font should be elegant but readable (suggest something like "Poiret One" or "Quicksand")
- Text animates in by fading and slightly scaling
- Messages positioned at varying depths and angles for visual interest

### Photo Display

- Photos appear on floating 3D planes with subtle rotation
- Subtle border glow in theme colors
- Hovering/tapping on photos causes them to expand slightly and increase brightness
- Photos can be surrounded by orbiting particles when active

### Color Scheme

- Primary background: Deep black (#0A0A0A)
- Stars: White (#FFFFFF) with varying opacity
- Accent colors: Soft brown (#8D6E63), Forest green (#4C7566)
- Text: Primarily white with subtle gradients into green or brown for emphasis
- Photo frames: Brown/green gradient (#8D6E63 to #4C7566)

## Mobile Optimizations

### Performance Adjustments

- Reduce particle count on mobile devices
- Simplify effects and animations
- Throttle scroll events to prevent performance issues

### Touch Interactions

- Implement swipe gestures for navigation
- Larger touch targets for interactive elements
- Add visual feedback for touch interactions

### Layout Adaptations

- Adjust text size and spacing for mobile screens
- Center content more prominently on smaller screens
- Ensure photos scale appropriately for mobile viewing

## Content Data Structure

Content should be structured as an array of objects with:

- Type (message or photo)
- Content (text or image path)
- Scroll threshold (when it appears)
- Optional metadata (alt text, special effects)

## Implementation Notes

### Scroll Handling

- Use a custom hook to track and normalize scroll position
- Implement smooth scrolling with easing functions
- Create a context to share scroll position across components

### Three.js Integration

- Use React Three Fiber for declarative Three.js implementation
- Create reusable components for stars, particles and effects
- Optimize rendering with instancing for particle systems

### Content Preparation

- 10-15 high-quality photos (recommend 1200x800px minimum)
- 15-20 short messages (reasons why you love her)
- Ensure images are optimized (WebP format ideal for web)

### Additional Features to Consider

- Add subtle background ambient music (with mute option)
- Include a "replay" button at the end to restart the experience
- Add a download feature to save the entire experience as a keepsake

This React-based implementation provides a responsive, performant experience that works well across both desktop and mobile devices, creating a memorable and unique birthday present that showcases your love and creativity.
